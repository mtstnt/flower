# Flower

Read: Flow-er

Is a frontend-only Flowchart runner.
Inspired by Flowgorithm ([http://www.flowgorithm.org/](http://www.flowgorithm.org/))

Note for source code readers:
- The code for the runner part (in the ./src/lib) is quite messy. I'm figuring things out as I go and will refactor it
once I'm comfortable. At least until the expression parser is finished.


To run:
1. Install npm, pnpm, or yarn. Run `[your package manager] install`
2. Run `[your package manager] run dev` to start the local dev server.
